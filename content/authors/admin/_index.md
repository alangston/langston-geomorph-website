My name is Abigail (Abby) Langston, and I am a fluvial geomorphologist. I am originally from Ozarks of northwest Arkansas. I received a Masterâ€™s degree from the University of Florida in 2009 with a focus on surface water and groundwater hydrology. The next stop was the Colorado Front Range where I developed a passion for pondering geomorphic processes while hiking, kayaking, and skiing. I received my PhD from the University of Colorado in 2014. My PhD research focused on hillslope weathering and sediment production, sediment transport in stream channels, and developing numerical models of strath terrace formation and lateral bedrock erosion. I then spent a year as a visiting scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands before joining K-State in 2016.

My recent research has been supported by the National Science Foundation and focuses on processes and controls on lateral bedrock erosion and mechanisms of wide bedrock valley development in the French Alps, the Ozarks Plateau of northwest Arkansas, and the Flint Hills of Kansas. See a recent CV [here](https://langston-geomorph.netlify.app/author/abby-langston/CV_Public.pdf).

In addition to research, I enjoy teaching undergrad and graduate students how the natural world around them functions and mentoring students in my active and growing research group.
