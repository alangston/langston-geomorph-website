We are researching the influence of talus piles on the evolution of wide bedrock valleys. Talus piles can protect the valley wall from lateral erosion, thus slowing the rate at which valley widening takes place. The longer a talus pile protects the bedrock valley wall from widening, the slower the overall widening rate. We are using both sediment and rock surface OSL dating to estimate the residence time for talus blocks sitting along the valley walls of both wide and narrow valleys in the Buffalo National River in northwest Arkansas. In this study, we aim to better constrain the rates at which valleys widen and shed light on the processes required to create wide bedrock valleys, a common geographic feature whose genesis is not yet understood.
