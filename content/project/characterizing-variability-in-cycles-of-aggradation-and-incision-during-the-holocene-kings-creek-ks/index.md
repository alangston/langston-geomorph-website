Perennial and ephemeral streams  Konza Prairie act as boundary conditions for the grassland ecosystem and host riparian ecosystems with diverse ecology (Dodds et al., 2004). Konza streams are currently undergoing incision and entrenchment that disconnects the streams from the floodplain and alters connectivity of sediment and water between the streams and hillslopes. Linking material transport and sediment dynamics to systematic drivers has relevance for water quality, habitat characterization, and downstream geomorphology (Ding et al., 2013; Ruegg et al. 2016; Veach et al., 2012). The driver of current stream incision is often attributed to changes in land-use or changes in climate (Oviatt, 1998). Several terrace levels that line the streams reveal repeated cycles of stream aggradation and incision in response to natural climate variability over the Holocene (Smith 1991) and demonstrate that the stream geomorphology in Konza Prairie is sensitive to external climate drivers. Key questions that we will address to better understand the response of grassland stream geomorphology to future changes in climate and land-use include: 1) What is the timescale of natural (non-anthropogenic) shifts in cycles of aggradation and incision on Kings Creek? 2) How long has Kings Creek been incising and how do abandonment ages of fluvial surfaces indicate which drivers ignited the current pulse of incision? 3) Can we observe a change in catchment hydrology or sedimentary dynamics of Kings Creek that identifies a shift from natural variability to changes in climate or land-use practices?
