Perennial and ephemeral streams that flow through Konza Prairie in the Flint Hills of northeast Kansasact as boundary conditions for the surrounding grassland ecosystem and host diverse riparian ecosystems. Kings Creek drains most of Konza Praire and is currently undergoing a phase of incision that disconnects the stream channels from the floodplain and alters connectivity of sediment and water between the streams and hillslopes. The driver of current stream incision is often attributed to changes in land-use and climate in the past ~150 years. Several levels of stream terraces reveal that Kings Creek has undergone repeated cycles of stream aggradation and incision in response to natural climate variability over the Holocene and late Pleistocene. The terraces also demonstrate that Kings Creek is sensitive to external climate drivers. In order to better understand and predict how grassland stream geomorphology will respond to future changes in climate and land-use, we are addressing key questions include: 1) What is the timescale of natural (non-anthropogenic) shifts in cycles of aggradation and incision on Kings Creek? 2) How long has Kings Creek been incising? 3) Can abandonment ages of fluvial surfaces distinguish among the possible drivers that ignited the current pulse of incision?
