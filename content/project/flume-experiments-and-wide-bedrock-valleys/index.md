In the summer and fall of 2022, Clay Robertson is conducting a series of flume experiments at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory in Minneapolis, MN. With these experiments, we aim to quantify how changes in sediment flux and discharge affect how quickly bedrock valleys widen and how wide a bedrock valley can grow. These experiments will help uncover the *processes* that control bedrock valley widening so that we can better understand how wide bedrock valleys were formed in the past.
