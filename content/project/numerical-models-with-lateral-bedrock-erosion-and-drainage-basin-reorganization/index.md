The prevalence of dendritic drainage networks around the world suggests that this pattern may be the optimal state in which rivers exist. We expect numerical models of river evolution to drastically reorganize suboptimal, nondendritic networks into more optimal dendritic networks. Physically based models of river basin evolution were incapable of achieving this result. We found that when numerical models were run with vertical incision alone, the landscape exhibited "extreme memory" and initial conditions remained after millions of years of model time. The key finding of this paper was that includinging lateral bedrock eorsion, in addition to vertical incision, the landscape underwent massive drainage reorganization and reached a state of dynamic equilibrium steady state. This work with collaborators **Jeffrey Kwang** (now at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory) and **Gary Parker** (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne) shows that adding lateral erosion to our landscape evolution models produced more realistic river systems that exist in a persistent reorganizational state instead of remaining in a set, stable configuration.
