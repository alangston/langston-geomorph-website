Rivers shape landscapes by incising deep canyons and carving both wide and narrow valleys, determining where people live and where floodwaters go. Little is known about how, when, and why rivers carve wide vs. narrow valleys as they flow through landscapes where they can "touch" the adjoining valley walls. This NSF-funded project includes Dr. Jill Marshall, University of Arkansas as co-PI. 

In this project, the we will study how bedrock valley width, widening rates, and associated valley bottom morphology are controlled by the persistence vs. mobility of collapsed valley wall material. The Buffalo River in northwest Arkansas is an ideal field site given the distinct lithologies that create both wide and narrow bedrock valleys. The project goals are 1) investigate the persistence of valley bottom cover as a function of the block sizes of collapsed bedrock wall material and 2) determine controls on the block size of collapsed material by characterizing fracture spacing in bedrock valley walls, using data from field measurements of valley and channel morphology and bedrock properties.
